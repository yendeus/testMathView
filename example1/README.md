# Example 1

This simple react app uses both a `MathFieldComponent` and a standard html input control to display the same content. Changes to either of them should propagate to the other one immediately. It demonstrates how to provide and retrieve the value of the math input in a react environment.

Install all dependencies by calling `npm install` in this folder.

Run via `npm run start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
